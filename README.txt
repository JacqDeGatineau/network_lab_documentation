I wanted to make a simple stack consisting of a switch, server, Linux PC 
and router in order to study networks, servers and just have fun. 
I also had a lot of old junk from years of scavenging, 
which I wanted to put into a good use.

Idea is to create a network with server and a linux machine to learn 
terminal and fool around safely, but also an vlan for IoT -things 
that I might add in the future. 

Archer -model (all TP-Link's) have recently been under a lot of heat 
for vulns, so great for studying security vulns.

Stack:
1. Cisco SG350
2. Lenovo ThinkCentre M72e
4. TP-link Archer C7
