Network Lab Stack

Overview

This setup is designed to facilitate hands-on learning of networking, server management, and security vulnerabilities. The stack includes a variety of equipment that will allow for experimentation with VLANs, terminal commands, network configurations, and security testing—specifically focusing on IoT vulnerabilities.

The lab is structured around a Cisco SG350 switch, a Lenovo ThinkCentre M72e server, and a TP-Link Archer C7 router, each chosen for their utility in providing a comprehensive networking environment. The goal is to create a secure, isolated network that allows for practical learning and experimentation in a controlled setting.

Components
	1.	Cisco SG350 Switch
Managed switch providing advanced features for VLANs, quality of service (QoS), and security configurations for simulating enterprise-level networking environments.
	2.	Lenovo ThinkCentre M72e Server
A versatile, cost-effective server for setting up Linux environments. This machine will serve as a host for various services and network management tasks, allowing for hands-on experience with Linux servers.
	3.	TP-Link Archer C7 Router
A consumer-grade router ideal for experimenting with common security vulnerabilities found in IoT devices. Given its recent exposure in security reports, it presents an excellent opportunity to study real-world security issues.

Use Case

This setup will be used to:
	•	Learn Networking: By configuring VLANs, experimenting with routing and switching, and setting up network services.
	•	Study Servers: Using the Lenovo ThinkCentre as a server for experimenting with Linux and gaining familiarity with the terminal and server management.
	•	Security Testing: Focus on studying vulnerabilities, especially in IoT devices, by setting up a dedicated VLAN for such devices and investigating their security weaknesses.
	•	Safe Experimentation: The isolated environment allows for risk-free experimentation without affecting production systems.

Future Plans
	•	Add IoT Devices: Eventually, IoT devices will be added to a dedicated VLAN, creating a safe sandbox environment to study vulnerabilities.
	•	Explore Security Research: Investigate common exploits and vulnerabilities, particularly those affecting TP-Link devices and other networked gadgets.
	•	Expand the Lab: Potentially expand the stack with more devices and services to further enhance learning opportunities.
