IDEAS:

1. maybe create router-on-a-stick situation, so that the network runs via the switch.
    + router can be plased in to a different location closer to the most clients
    - security, WAN connection has to be really thought out well
2. PI-Hole to stop adds in the netwroks
    + no adds
    - installation ?
    - will it interfect with enterprise equipment with VPN?
3. Wireguard
4. UFW
    + limit SSH to LAN only
5. Kali Tools
6. Subnetting challenge
7. Layer 3 IP Rputing and SVIs
8. Port Security and ACLs
9. Spanning Tree Protocol abd redundancy testing
10. packet sniffing and traffic analysis
11. SSH access securely to the switch.
    - This is quite difficult on sg350, since the cli is deifferent from catalyst
    + Limit to LAN only
12. log server, syslog-ng or graylog
13. IoT security and traffic segmentation
14. Set up EVE-NG on Linux server
